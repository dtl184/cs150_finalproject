## How to run code
<Clear instructions on how to run your submitted code. These instructions must at least cover how to generate sheet music and, separately, how to generate a midi. If you had to install any new libraries to get your code to work, those libraries should also be listed here with instructions of how to install them. If Richard cannot install these libraries, he can’t run and grade your code; it’s in your best interest to check that Richard can install these libraries well before the submission deadline.>

## Overview
<Paragraph giving a high-level summary of your overall compositional approach

## Other insights
<(Optional) any additional interesting details you’d like to share about your approach or how you implemented it.>
